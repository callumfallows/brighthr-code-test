# Context for FileDirectory

## Description

This code creates a central place to manage and share file-related data and operations across different parts of an application. It handles file listing, searching, and sorting capabilities that can be used by any component that needs to display or manipulate files.

## Inputs

- It takes file data from a useFiles hook that fetches file information
- It accepts search input from users to filter files
- It receives the current URL path to determine which directory to show
- It takes children components that will use this context

## Outputs

- Provides filtered and sorted lists of files
- Exposes sorting toggle states (alphabetical A-Z/Z-A and date new/old)
- Offers functions to sort files and search through them
- Makes all this data available to other components through React context

## The Logic Flow

1. When the component loads, it gets the file data and current directory from the URL
2. It filters files to show only those in the current directory
3. When users type in a search, it filters files to match the search term
4. Users can sort these files either alphabetically or by date, and toggle the sort direction
5. All this processed data is then made available through the context provider
